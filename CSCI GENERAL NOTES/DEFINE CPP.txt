TERMINOLOGY MAINLY USED IN c++ / CPP FOLDERS

---------------------------------
MODULUS  | REMAINDER :

%
---------------------------------

PRINT LINE FORMATTING

\n      : adds a enter input | blank space

---------------------------------
FSTREAM | READ/WRITE FILES | INPUT/OUTPUT FILES :


#include <fstream>
/* 
fstream is a datatype that represents file streaming. 
it is capable of ofstream and ifstream which can create 
fstream.
	ofstream outputs and writes files
	ifstream inputs and reads files

*/

ifstream var;

var.open("file_name.txt")

-
endl; writes an empty sentence. Thus, it can only be used for cout/output streams.

---------------------------------
NAMESPACE

using namespace std;			defines the standard c++ library 

---------------------------------
DATA TYPES

char        smallest address unit | contain types such as integers, characters etc | 1 byte

--

int        contain types such as integers | 2-4 bytes | ranges from -2^(31) to 2^(31)-1

--

bool	   contain types such as True and False | 

--

double	 | double precision data type | 8 bytes
--
float 		can contain e for exponents and decimals | single precision data type | 4 bytes 
--

long datatype   | used when comparing close to infinitely large numbers

--
long long datatype | used when comparing close to infinitely large numbers | is 64-bit wide
--

short datatype    | used when comparing decimal worth of numbers

--

signed datatype typially dealt with data storage | i.e  -128 to +127

--

unsigned datatype     typically dealt with data storage   | can hold only 0 and positive values | ranges from 0 to 2^(32)-1 | i.e 0 to 255


--
void           | non assigned type, can not create variables with void.


---------------------------------

HEADER FILE (".h")

all class function prototypes and declerations go here instead of main file.

the header files help when distributing amongst engineers which allows  the usage of functions without tweaking the function itself.

#include "classname.h"   , requires to be included in the main.cpp to use objects of the class.

---------------------------------
"::"  Binary scope resolution operator.

the .cpp file will be where the functions go.
"class::functionname()"  refers to the function's body.
---------------------------------
vector::push_back():

push_back() function is used to push elements into a vector from the back. The new value is inserted into the vector at the end, after the current last element and the container size is increased by 1.

Input : myvector = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        myvector.push_back(6);
Output :1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Input : myvector = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
        myvector.push_back(0);
Output :5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0

---------------------------------
Difference between C , C++, and C#

C is for old and small memory space machines

C++ is the superset of C. (encompasses and more)
C++ can also manage class types. There is no difference of speed, just introduction of object orientation programming.
C# is similar to java, works on the .net ecosystem. Very powerful, can create backend, frontend, and ios applications i.e. video games e.g. Unity. Not as fast as c++ because the compiler is done mostly automatic. C# helps developer program fast but C++ makes the program run fast.
